      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>As a  member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saint
         I can see the necessity to have informed the members of the ward 
         about what activities have each organization and how the members 
         have to be involved.

        Some families have kids in primary,  young men or young girls and it is
         important to have the information in the computers, tablets, or phones. 
         And at the same time we need to give the sacrament meeting program 
         electronically. This project is also to full fill what we read in D. and C. 69:3, 
        “And also That he shall continue in writing and making a histoy of all the important things which he shall observe and know concerning my church;”
        and D&C 69:5 “And also, my servants who are abroad in the earth should send forth the accounts of their stewardships to the land of Zion;”</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Take the information to each member of the organization who has a computer, tablet, or smart phone.

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
